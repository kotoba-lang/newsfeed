  "Read the source catalog, and re-join its editorial fields onto ledger
   articles at query time.

   The ledger records what was observed; the catalog records what we currently
   think of the observer. Credibility, source class and rights policy belong to
   the second — they are revised as we learn — and an append-only ledger cannot
   be revised. An article ingested before a source's class existed carries no
   class forever, so reading those fields off the stored record means catalog
   edits silently do not apply to anything already ingested. (Measured
   2026-08-03: adding `:news.source/class` changed nothing until this join
   existed, because every article in the ledger predated the field.)

   The ingest still writes its snapshot of these fields into the ledger. That
   is provenance — what was believed at the time — and the join below always
   wins over it.

   Pure `.cljc`."
