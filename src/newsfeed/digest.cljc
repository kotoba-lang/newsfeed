  "Ranked articles → the brief a video episode is produced from.

   This is the last stop before the LLM. Everything here is deterministic, so
   the same ledger and the same day produce the same brief, and a bad episode
   can be traced to either the brief (data) or the storyboard (the model) —
   never to an ambiguous mix of both.

   The brief carries its citations as data. `newscaster`'s EditorialGovernor
   enforces `cites ⊆ ingested`, and a brief whose citations are article ids
   from the ledger satisfies that by construction rather than by the model
   being careful.

   Pure `.cljc`."

     0.30  3 merges, 2 false  — also merged two different Dell laptop reviews
     0.25  6 merges, 4 true / 2 false

   0.25 finds three more genuine duplicates (an AM5 firmware launch, a MinIO
   announcement, a Nutanix/Dell integration) and that is tempting. It is
   refused because the errors are not symmetric: under-merging shows one story
   twice, which a viewer sees and forgives, while over-merging DELETES a story
   by filing it as corroboration of an unrelated one, where nobody sees it
   again. Redundancy is visible; suppression is not."

   same story twice, so a high title overlap within one outlet means related
   coverage, not duplication — measured: two Dell laptop reviews from one site,

   Ranking alone does not make a running order. Measured on the first real

   abstracts are keyword-dense by construction) and the storage channel took
   five of six items from a single trade outlet. Neither is a false positive —
   every item was on-topic and correctly scored — which is exactly why the
   scorer is the wrong place to fix it. A digest of one publisher is a press
   review, not a news bulletin.

   A skipped cluster is not discarded: it stays available as corroboration and
