  "Feed item + its source → an article datom.

   Attribute names are `:news/*` and `:news.source/*`, taken verbatim from
   `cloud-itonami/news`'s `news.schema` — including its `art-<sha256hex(url)>`
   id convention. That A-layer's Worker is unreachable today (news.gftd.ai
   times out; see ADR-2608031500), but its schema is the workspace's existing
   vocabulary for this data and inventing a parallel one would mean a
   translation layer the day it or a successor comes back.

   The sha-256 is injected rather than required: a digest is host IO in nbb
   (`node:crypto`) and on the JVM (`MessageDigest`), and this namespace stays
   pure so the mapping is testable without either.

   Pure `.cljc`."
