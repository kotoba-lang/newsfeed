  "Rank the shared article pool for one channel.

   The catalog deliberately lets channels share feeds — The Register publishes
   one all-sections feed and both channels read it — so the gate that decides
   what belongs to a channel lives here rather than in the source list. Without
   it a storage channel leads with a story about Windows activation errors.

   Three signals, all cheap and all inspectable:

     keywords   weighted terms, counted in the title at double weight because a
                headline is written to say what the article is about
     url-hints  substrings of the article url, positive and negative. The
                strongest available signal on a section-organised publisher:
                `/storage/` in the path is an editor's own classification,
                which beats any guess made from prose.
     source     the catalog's editorial credibility, as a small tiebreak

   Recency is applied last and only as a tiebreak, never as a gate — the
   freshness window is a separate, explicit decision in `newsfeed.article`.

   The result carries `:score/matched`, so a ranking can be explained rather
   than trusted. Pure `.cljc`."
