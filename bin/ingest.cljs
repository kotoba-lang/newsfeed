(ns ingest
  "Fetch every active source, map items to article datoms, append the new ones
   to the ledger, and report per-source what actually happened.

   The report is the point as much as the ingest is. A feed that 404s, one that
   answers 200 with an empty document, and one that parses to zero items are
   three different faults with three different fixes, and a run that printed
   only a total would hide all of them behind a smaller number. Every source
   ends up in exactly one bucket and the buckets are printed even when empty.

   Exit code is 0 unless EVERY source failed — a partial ingest is a normal
   night, not an error, and making it non-zero would train the caller to
   ignore the code."
