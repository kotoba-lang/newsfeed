  "Ledger + channel → the episode brief, as EDN on stdout or to a file.

     nbb --classpath src:resources bin/digest.cljs --channel murakumo-gpu-ai \\
       [--ledger state/articles.ledger.edn] [--sources resources/sources.edn] \\
       [--out brief.edn] [--top 6] [--now 2026-08-03T00:00:00Z] [--explain]

   `--now` exists so a brief is reproducible: the same ledger and the same
   instant always yield the same brief, which is what makes a bad episode
   traceable to the data rather than to when it happened to run.

   Exit 0 with a brief, 3 when nothing cleared the channel's threshold. A day
   with no story is not an error, but a caller chaining into production needs
   to tell the two apart without parsing prose."
